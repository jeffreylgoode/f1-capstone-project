    "# F1 Tire Degradation Modeling & Pit Strategy Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula 1 (F1) is a very competitive motor sport and the margin for victory can sometimes be razor thin.  For example, for the 2025 season, Lando Norris won the championship with 423 points versus Max Verstappen’s 421 points.   The championship title was decided in the season’s last race (Abi Dhabi), and yet it could have been secured earlier, a race before, if it were not for two errors – a car specification disqualification in Las Vegas, and a pit stop strategy blunder in Qatar.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will focus pit stop strategy by answering this question, “As a F1 Team Principal, when should we pit?”.   I propose answering this question by building a race simulator and pit strategy optimizer that answers the question each lap, should we pit now, or wait?   In the case of the 2025 Qatar race, when the Safety Car was deployed on lap 7, the pit strategy optimizer may have answered the question, “yes”, pit immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is of the project is to focus on F1 pit strategy in the face of tire degradation, available tires, tire usage rules, and the uncertainty of traffic, safety car deployment and decisions made by the other teams.    There are several potential opportunities for use of regression or ML techniques including but not limited to:\n",
    "    - tire degredation modeling\n",
    "    - fule consumption\n",
    "    - race simulation efficiency\n",
    "    - and decision analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes:\n",
    "- Data exploration\n",
    "- Tire degradation modeling\n",
    "- Model validation and comparison\n",
    "- Pit strategy optimization and decision analysis\n",
    "- Final insights and recommendations"

    "The approach for answering the question, when should I pit requires a system approach.  F1 teams have access to fastf1 data as well as their own recorded car telemetry for each race venue, and likely for several years.  Utlimately as each F1 team approaches a race weekend, they will be using practive and qualifying data to tune a race day strategy, fuel load, tire compound, analysis of prior race Safety Car deployments, as well as evaluating what other teams did on race day.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Build a race simulator that has inputs of total laps, a simple model for tire degradation and pit loss\n",

    "- Build a strategy optimizer which iterates through all \"legal\" possible tire compond strategies. By legal, F1 has some rules for tire usage and pitting\n",
    "\n",
    "My working theory, is that a F1 team principal would use the simulator and optimizer before race day to select a plan A, B, and C for tire compound strategies that have been informed by Safety Car probabilities.  Then, as the race unfolds, the optimizer would rerun candidate strategies based on real time conditions.  For example, \"we are at lap 7, and a Safety Car was just deployed, what are our best strategy options going forward?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "From my research, ML could be used to help with downselection strategy options in the heat of the moment, versus a total rerun of the race simulator with the candidate options.   This is to be yet determined.\n",
