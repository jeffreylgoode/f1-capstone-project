    "# F1 Tire Degradation Modeling & Pit Strategy Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula 1 is a very competitive motor sport and the margin for victory can sometimes be razor thin.  For example, for the 2025 season, Lando Norris won the championship with 423 points versus Max Verstappen’s 421 points.   The championship title was decided in the season’s last race (Abi Dhabi), and yet it could have been secured earlier, a race before, if it were not for two errors – a car specification disqualification in Las Vegas, and a pit stop strategy blunder in Qatar.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will focus on the pit strategy blunder in Qatar by answering this question.  “As a F1 Team Principal, when should we pit?”.   I propose answering this question by building a race simulator and pit strategy optimizer that answers the question each lap, should I pit now, or wait?   In the case of the 2025 Qatar race, when the Safety Car was deployed on lap 7, the pit strategy optimizer would have answered the question, “yes”, pit immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is of the project is to focus on F1 pit strategy in the face of tire degradation, available tires, tire usage rules, traffic and safety car deployment.    There are at least two potential opportunities for use of regression or ML techniques – modeling tire degradation and improving pit decision outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project models Formula 1 tire degradation using multiple approaches (linear regression, quadratic regression, and machine learning models) and uses these models to build a pit strategy optimizer that minimizes total race time.\n",
